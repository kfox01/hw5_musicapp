Problem 3

For setup, I simply followed the guide that was given in the tutorial setup and have been running my tests individually... I was under the impression we were supposed to be able to run all the tests in the folder at once, however whenever I did this no tests would run. That being said, the tests are able to run when the files are called. 

For example, running the update song test would look like 
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/testPut_Updateong.php

Other than that, I don't think there is anything special about the setup to the project. The backend code is supplied in the repo, although there are hardly any changes from the pset 3 backend that we had previously.

Problem 6

The use of AI within this part of pset 5 was a bit rough at first as it was giving a lot of repetitive errors and not able to help me error check as much as I was hoping. However, after I was able to get a few of the tests done, I had no problem using AI to give it the relevant code and prompt and have ot follow the structure of my previous test while making the minor adjustments that the test called for. Only really used it for the Update and Add song tests after getting the structure for the delete.
